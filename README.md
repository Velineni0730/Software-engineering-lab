## Experiment 2: Weather Modelling Using Quadratic Regression (Waterfall Model)

**Objective:**  
To develop a weather forecasting model that predicts temperature, humidity, and wind speed for each hour of the day using a quadratic regression approach. The software was developed following the **Waterfall Model** to ensure structured execution.

**Approach:**  
- Collected hourly weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed).
- Used a **second-degree polynomial (quadratic model)** for each weather parameter.
- Fitted the model using **NumPy’s `polyfit()`**.
- Generated predictions from 0 to 24 hours.
- Visualized original vs predicted data using **Matplotlib** with clear subplots.

**Development Process:**  
The project was executed through the five Waterfall phases:
1. **Requirement Analysis**: Defined inputs, outputs, and prediction goals.
2. **Design**: Created system structure and mathematical model.
3. **Implementation**: Developed the code in Python.
4. **Testing**: Verified model accuracy and plot outputs.
5. **Deployment**: Prepared `.py` and `.html` outputs for GitHub.

**Tools & Technologies:**   
- Python 3
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- VS Code

##  Experiment 3: Weather Modelling Using Iterative Model

**Objective:**  
To develop and improve a weather prediction system through multiple iterations, progressively refining the model's accuracy and expanding its scope.

**Approach:**  
The model evolves through successive iterations, allowing for continuous enhancements based on scope expansion and user feedback.

###  Iteration Breakdown:

1. **Iteration 1 – Basic Model:**  
   - Implemented a simple quadratic model for temperature prediction.  
   - All team members collaborated on data collection, coding, and testing.

2. **Iteration 2 – Scope Expansion:**  
   - Added features for predicting humidity and wind speed.  
   - Enhanced data validation and refined coefficient fitting logic.

3. **Iteration 3 – User Feedback Integration:**  
   - Collected feedback to assess usability and model performance.  
   - Incorporated suggestions to improve prediction accuracy and output readability.

4. **Final Iteration – Optimization:**  
   - Optimized the model for real-time application scenarios.  
   - Ensured compatibility with extended weather monitoring systems or external APIs.

**Tools & Technologies Used:**  
- Python 3  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Iterative Software Development Process

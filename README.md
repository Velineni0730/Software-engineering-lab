## Experiment 2: Weather Modelling Using Quadratic Regression (Waterfall Model)

**Objective:**  
To develop a weather forecasting model that predicts temperature, humidity, and wind speed for each hour of the day using a quadratic regression approach. The software was developed following the **Waterfall Model** to ensure structured execution.

**Approach:**  
- Collected hourly weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed).
- Used a **second-degree polynomial (quadratic model)** for each weather parameter.
- Fitted the model using **NumPyâ€™s `polyfit()`**.
- Generated predictions from 0 to 24 hours.
- Visualized original vs predicted data using **Matplotlib** with clear subplots.

**Development Process:**  
The project was executed through the five Waterfall phases:
1. **Requirement Analysis**: Defined inputs, outputs, and prediction goals.
2. **Design**: Created system structure and mathematical model.
3. **Implementation**: Developed the code in Python.
4. **Testing**: Verified model accuracy and plot outputs.
5. **Deployment**: Prepared `.py` and `.html` outputs for GitHub.

**Tools & Technologies:**   
- Python 3
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- VS Code
